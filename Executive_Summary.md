**Executive Summary â€“ Customer Churn Analytics with PostgreSQL**

This project analyzes customer churn in the banking sector using SQL and PostgreSQL, completed as part of a mentor-led internship by MentorMind in collaboration with upGrad and Jupiter. The goal was to identify key drivers of customer attrition and provide strategic recommendations to improve retention.

The dataset contains records for 10,000 banking customers, including attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, account balance, and churn status. PostgreSQL was used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) through SQL queries, uncovering patterns in customer behavior.

Key findings include:
- **Germany** had the highest churn rate (~32%), indicating a need for region-specific retention efforts.
- **Inactive users with high account balances** were more likely to churn.
- **Older customers and those using fewer products** showed a higher tendency to exit.
- **Female customers** had slightly higher churn compared to males.

Based on these insights, the project recommends targeted strategies such as:
- Personalized re-engagement campaigns for inactive users
- Loyalty programs for high-balance customers
- Product bundling and cross-selling for users with low engagement

The project used SQL techniques like `GROUP BY`, conditional aggregations, subqueries, and filtering logic to derive insights. This exercise demonstrated how structured query language (SQL) can uncover valuable business intelligence and inform customer-centric decision-making in the financial sector.
